## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - Advance JS
- [TailwindCSS](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [@uidotdev/usehooks](https://github.com/uidotdev/usehooks) - For dynamic screen size detect

### Continued development

The following feature can be added in the future:

- [ ] Animation with Framer Motion library.
- [ ] Complicated State management with Redux (for example: Store multiple products and share globally in the app).
- [ ] Add Search Bar and Product API to allow user search for different product rather than the current static product.

### Useful resources

- [@uidotdev/usehooks](https://github.com/uidotdev/usehooks) - This is very useful collection of custom React hooks. In
  this project, I use its **useWindowSize** hook to get the window width for responsive behavior.
